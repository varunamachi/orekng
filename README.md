New Orek - Observe Record Kontrol

Orek is a service that acts a middleman between endpoints and client. Where endpoints are remote/local systems with read-only variables and tunable parameters. Orek also provides user management and access control for clients.

Orek is work in progress. First phase of client REST API implementation is complete. Next step is to implement APIs for endpoints to report values and for Orek to update endpoints' paramerts.
